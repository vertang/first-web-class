<h2>Web 이란</h2>
<p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information
system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform
Resource Locators
which may be interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible
over the Internet.[1][2] The resources of the Web are transferred
via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users
by a software application called a web browser,
and are published by a software application called a web server.
The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet,
which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades
and upon which technologies the Web is built.
