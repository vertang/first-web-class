<h2>JavaScript 란</h2>
<p>
  JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the
  ECMAScript specification.
  JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.
   It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing,
  prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

  Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
  Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,
   often incorporating third-party libraries.[12] All major web browsers have a
  dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.

  As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
  It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates,
  regular expressions, standard data structures,
  and the Document Object Model (DOM).
